Runsim readme:

See runsim -help for runsim commandline options.

Runsim is a perl script that is intended to integrate all of the tedious
command lines for simulation and back annotating designs.  The cavets of
using runsim are in the directory structures it expects.  It expects to
be run a 'tmp' directory, which is where any commands run from runsim
will dump their generated files.  Anything in the 'tmp' directory can be
removed at anytime and can be regenerated by the runsim command.  The
other directories it grabs source files from are 'rtl' and then 'tb'.
The 'rtl' directory is meant for synthesizable verilog files.  The 'tb'
directory is meant for testbench related files.  The 'inputs' directory
is meant for the test input files.

Example directory structure:

project/
   |- rtl/
   |- tb/
   |- inputs/
   |- tmp/

A typical runsim command

runsim.pl -stim ../inputs/text.v
